Every Pianola app consists of a foundation:

... a set of pre-fabricated building blocks:

... and a configuration file:

... which informs the application which building blocks go on the foundation, the result being a working web application:

Let's get a bit more specific:

## The Foundation

Every app comes with a set of basic features that are common to all applications built with Pianola, this includes:

2. A quick-search filter to quickly find a record.
3. A detailed query builder for precise queries.
4. Various views, including a record detail view, a list view, and a mixed view split either vertically or horizontally.
